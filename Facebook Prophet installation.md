# Prophet Installation in Python
Prophet is on PyPI, so you can use pip to install it:

The major dependency that Prophet has is pystan. PyStan has its own installation instructions. http://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_beginner.html
 

## Windows
On Windows, PyStan requires a compiler so youâ€™ll need to follow the instructions.
